# Introduction

The global smart home market is growing at a fast
pace, with an expected value of USD 53.45 billion in 2022.
Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Apple HomePod are the
most famous smart home devices. They are getting
popular and changing our daily life.

Amazon released Alexa, a 9-inch tall cylinder speaker
controlled by a cloud-base voice assistant in Nov 2014.
Following the Amazon Alexa's popularity, Alphabet released
the Google Home in late 2016. At the end of December 2017,
Apple will also be joining the fray with the Siri-powered HomePod.

They are similar products that serve as intelligent personal
assistant and could be used as a home automation system.
Therefore, I am motivated to study how people comment them on Twitter.

The goal of this project is to study the brand perception of 
Amazon Alexa, Google Home and Apple Home using Twitter data.
Through the text mining of twitter data, we can know how people
perceive these similar products, assess the efficiency of companies'
marketing strategy and help these three companies to improve their
marketing strategy.


# Set up Twitter

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(devtools)
library(twitteR)
library(tidytext)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(scales)
library(wordcloud)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
get_sentiments("bing")
```

The codes below enable us to set up Twitter,
which will be used to get tweets.

api_key <- 	"RrPTCIryCswqP35AFeanh73cV"

api_secret <- "w4JEhIMHsEArgaandqAtTqhc610kRvenP8e8fdXfSRCnuLVsn9"

access_token <- "927638841925742593-3NjhdkxNIJRbGQ8PPDIMIpFskIMFpPd"

access_token_secret <- "Qfd1mKmPbi0E6O6cmblVG4Fmi6CQceG1CtbyQKR28nAAY"

setup_twitter_oauth(api_key, 
                    api_secret, 
                    access_token, 
                    access_token_secret)


# Get tweets that contain our key words

The codes below extract 3000 tweets for each product,
and transform the tweets into data frame work


Alexatweet <- searchTwitter("Amazon Alexa", 
                        n=3000, lang="en", since="2014-01-01")
                        
Alexatweetdf <- twListToDF(Alexatweet)


GoogleHometweet <- searchTwitter("Google Home", 
                             n=3000, lang="en", since="2014-01-01")
                             
GoogleHometweetdf <- twListToDF(GoogleHometweet)


AppleHometweet <- searchTwitter("Apple HomePod", 
                                  n=3000, lang="en", since="2014-01-01")
                                  
AppleHometweetdf <- twListToDF(AppleHometweet)


# Store the tweets data

The codes below store our extracted tweets in csv files,
which facilitate us to run our text analysis without running the
code above every time.

write.csv(Alexatweetdf,"Alexa.csv")

write.csv(GoogleHometweetdf,"GoogleHome.csv")

write.csv(AppleHometweetdf,"AppleHome.csv")


# Text Analysis

## 1) Import the stored data and unnest tokens the tweets texts

The codes below help us to break the tweets texts into words.

```{r}

Alexadf<-read.csv("Alexa.csv")
GHdf<-read.csv("GoogleHome.csv")
AHdf<-read.csv("AppleHome.csv")


Alexatext<-select(Alexadf,text)
Alexatext$text<-as.character(Alexatext$text)
Alexatext<- Alexatext %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, text)


GHtext<-select(GHdf,text)
GHtext$text<-as.character(GHtext$text)
GHtext<- GHtext %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, text)


AHtext<-select(AHdf,text)
AHtext$text<-as.character(AHtext$text)
AHtext<- AHtext %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, text)

```


## 2) remove stop words

The stop words package enables us to remove no-meaning 
or conjunction words, I also created my own stop words.

```{r}
mystopwords<-c("https","rt","htt","votedougjones")

mystopwords<-as.data.frame(mystopwords)
colnames(mystopwords)<-"word"
mystopwords$word<-as.character(mystopwords$word)

Alexa<-Alexatext %>%
  anti_join(stop_words) %>% 
  anti_join(mystopwords) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  filter(str_detect(word,"^[a-z']+$"))

GH<-GHtext %>%
  anti_join(stop_words) %>% 
  anti_join(mystopwords) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  filter(str_detect(word,"^[a-z']+$"))

AH<-AHtext %>%
  anti_join(stop_words) %>% 
  anti_join(mystopwords) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  filter(str_detect(word,"^[a-z']+$"))

```


# Alexa EDA

```{r, echo=FALSE}

Alexa %>%
  with(wordcloud(word, n, max.words = 50, colors = brewer.pal(8, "Dark2")))

```

As we can see, the tops words of Alexa are Alexa, Amazon, music, wake, echo, win, chance, amp, follow, dorischristmas, alarms, and gift.

These words reflect the main features of Alexa perceived by
customers:

First, it's a smart echo produced by Amazon;

Second, people use it to play music and also use as the alarm to wake them up;

Third, people consider it to be a good Christmas gift and there are some
marketing campaigns where people can win Alexa as a free gift.

Besides, we also found the words like, Alex, Jones, and CIA. As Alexa Jones grilled an Amazon Echo on his show, asking Alexa — the device’s personal assistant — about its connections to the CIA.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Alexa %>%
  filter(n > 210) %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, n)) +
  geom_col(fill="cornflowerblue") +
  xlab(NULL) +
  coord_flip()+
  ggtitle("Alexa Words Frequency")+
  ylab("Count")
```


# Google Home EDA

```{r, echo=FALSE}
GH %>%
  with(wordcloud(word, n, max.words = 50, colors = brewer.pal(8, "Dark2")))
```

The top words for Google Home are: home, google, max, smart, speaker, mini, follow, sign, volume and incredible.

These words reflect how people perceive Google Home:

First, Google Home is a mini smart speaker;

Second, there is a new product called Google Home Max with bigger volume;

Third, there are ongoing marketing events on Twitter, where you follow a company and you can get Google Home;

Besides, incredible implies that people have a positive impression of Google Home.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
GH %>%
  filter(n > 200) %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, n)) +
  geom_col(fill="brown3") +
  xlab(NULL) +
  coord_flip()+
  ggtitle("Google Home Words Frequency")+
  ylab("Count")
```


# Apple Home EDA

```{r, echo=FALSE}
AH %>%
  with(wordcloud(word, n, max.words = 50, colors = brewer.pal(8, "Dark2")))
```

As we can see, the top words of Apple Home are apple, homepod, win, giving, enter, gleamapp, winner, lucky home, cnet, siri, audio.

From these top words we can see how customer perceive Apple HomePod:

First, Gleam is doing Apple HomePod Giveaway campaign, where people
can win Apple HomePod as a free gift;

Second, cnet published a news that Apple HomePod is delayed until early 2018;

Third, Apple HomePod is powered by Siri and allows multi-speaker audio streaming;

Besides, we can see people are comparing Apple HomePod with Google Home.

People are also discussing the price of Apple HomePod, as it has the higher price
compared with Alexa and Google Home.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
AH %>%
  filter(n > 100) %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, n)) +
  geom_col(fill="darkgray") +
  xlab(NULL) +
  coord_flip()+
  ggtitle("Apple Home Words Frequency")+
  ylab("Count")
```


# Sentiment analysis

```{r, echo=FALSE}

AlexaST <- Alexa %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>%
  spread(sentiment, n, fill = 0) %>%
  mutate(sentiment = positive - negative)

ggplot(data = AlexaST,aes(word,sentiment,fill=sentiment))+
  geom_col()+theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())+
  ggtitle("Alexa Sentiment Analysis")

```

We did sentiment analysis to see how people's comment on Alexa. Overall, there are more positive words about Alexa.

We can see there are some negative words with high frequency, such as hard and lying, which may indicate people have some difficulties of properly using Alexa.

While win is a positive word with very high frequency related to Alexa, we can see people are interested in the marketing campaign of Alexa.


```{r, echo=FALSE}

GHst <- GH %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>%
  spread(sentiment, n, fill = 0) %>%
  mutate(sentiment = positive - negative)

ggplot(data = GHst,aes(word,sentiment,fill=sentiment))+
  geom_col()+theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())+
  ggtitle("GoogleHome Sentiment Analysis")

```

Overall, there are more positive words about Google Home.

We can see there are some negative words, such as damn and loud, indicating people feel google home is loud.

While smart and incredible are positive words with high frequency, we can see more people think Google Home is smart and incredible


```{r, echo=FALSE}
AHst <- AH %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>%
  spread(sentiment, n, fill = 0) %>%
  mutate(sentiment = positive - negative)

ggplot(data = AHst,aes(word,sentiment,fill=sentiment))+
  geom_col()+theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())+
  ggtitle("AppleHome Sentiment Analysis")

```

Unlike Amazon Alexa and Google Home, Apple HomePod has more positive words, such as lucky, win and winner, which is related to the marketing campaign.

Still, there are some negative words but with lower frequency like bugs, delay
and wrong.


# Correlation analysis

```{r}

allproduct<- bind_rows(mutate(GH, product = "GoogleHome"),
                       mutate(AH, product = "AppleHome"), 
                       mutate(Alexa, product = "Alexa")) 


allpro <- allproduct %>% 
  mutate(proportion = round(n / sum(n),5)) %>% 
  select(-n) %>% 
  spread(product, proportion) %>% 
  gather(product, proportion, "GoogleHome":"AppleHome") %>%
  na.omit(proportion)


cor.test(data = allpro[allpro$product == "GoogleHome",],
         ~ proportion + Alexa)

cor.test(data = allpro[allpro$product == "AppleHome",], 
         ~ proportion + Alexa)


allpro2 <- allproduct %>% 
  mutate(proportion = round(n / sum(n),5)) %>% 
  select(-n) %>% 
  spread(product, proportion) %>% 
  gather(product, proportion, "AppleHome":"Alexa") %>%
  na.omit(proportion)

cor.test(data = allpro2[allpro2$product == "AppleHome",], 
         ~ proportion + GoogleHome)

```

As they are similar products, we did correlation analysis.

Our null hypothesis test: there is no correlation between the sentiment
of two products.

The significance level is 0.05.

We found there is small positive correlation between the sentiment of Alexa
and apple home.

No significant correlation between Alexa and Google Home nor between Google
Home and Apple Home.


# Conclusion

![Alexa, Apple Home, Google Home](all.jpg)

We can see there are both similarity and difference in people's perception
to Alexa, Google Home, and Apple Home.

The features of alarm and music player of Alexa are perceived by the customer,
while there are a lot of other features that Amazon can put efforts to promote
among customers, such as controlling smart home devices, read news and audiobooks,
and make calls.There are some negative aspects of Alexa, like a connection with CIA. 
Amazon could clarify on public and build a good image of Alexa.

While Google Home has a better reputation in the market, people recognize it as
a smart and incredible home device. But people are also complaining the loud volume
of Google Home. Google could improve the volume control and solve some technical bugs
of google home. There are not many discussions about the specific features of Google Home. Google could make some efforts to promote the specific features of Google Home.

Apple Home hasn't been launched yet, but people are discussing it a lot,
such as the delay of its release, the price and the techniques including 
Siri and audio streaming. And People are comparing it with Google Home.
So it's import for Apple to promote some special features that separate
Apple Home from Google Home and Alexa.

All these three products have online marketing campaigns which attract customers.
Christmas would be a good opportunity to promote these products.
